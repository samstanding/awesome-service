Thanks for checking out my awesome service! 

This is a simple sign up form app that allows a user to enter their name, email and password and it routes them to a page that displays that information. The application is written using React and Typescript. For unit and integration testing I used Jest and React Testing Library. I used Cypress for end to end testing. 

To run locally you'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. 

First clone my repo locally, then run `npm install`. 

To run the app run `npm start`. 

To run all unit and integration tests run `npm test`. 

To run end to end tests, run `npx cypress open`. That should open the Cypress app on your machine. Under Integration Tests you should see app_spec.js, click that or the "Run All Specs" button above the Integration tests to kick off the tests.

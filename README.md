Thanks for checking out my awesome service! 

This is a simple sign up form app that allows a user to enter their name, email and password and it routes them to a page that displays that information. The application is written using React and Typescript. For unit and integration testing I used Jest and React Testing Library. I used Cypress for end to end testing. 

To run locally you'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. 

First clone my repo locally, then run `npm install`. 

To run the app run `npm start`. 

To run unit and integration tests run `npm test` then type `a` to run all tests. 

To run end to end tests, run `npx cypress open`. That should open the Cypress app on your machine. Under Integration Tests you should see app_spec.js, click that or the "Run All Specs" button above the Integration tests to kick off the tests. You must have the application running on your local machine at port 3000 for the end to end tests to run.

Thanks for checking out this repo! 

To run locally you'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. 

First clone my repo locally, then run `npm install`. 

To run the app run `npm start`. 

To run all unit and integration tests run `npm test`. 

To run end to end tests, run `npx cypress open`. That should open the Cypress app on your machine. Under Integration Tests you should see app_spec.js, click that or the "Run All Specs" button above the Integration tests to kick off the tests.
